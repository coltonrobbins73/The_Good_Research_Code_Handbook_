#### First take

This text aims to outline best practices for code architecture for research scientists who might not have a formal computer science education.

#### Motivation

This text seems like a great starting point for learning good coding fundamentals before I get involved in a major project.

#### Post-completion review

Looking back on the opening flow chart, which was initially quite foreign to me, I can see that I have learned a wide range of concepts. However, during the study process, the material was simple and easy to digest. I felt that a lot of intimidating concepts surrounding the overall structure of a project have been demystified for me. In summary, I feel that this information was very valuable and the value will continue to compound as I make more and more well-designed projects.

I will say that this text was designed to be simple yet terse, so my typical strategy of summarizing the text might not have been necessary here.
