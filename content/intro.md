### A note on memory

Neuroscience research has demonstrated that coding is especially demanding on our memory systems. In contrast to language processing, coding forces the user to retain information on many interworking components. Failure to retain even some of these components forces the user to re-evaluate the entire system and slows progress immensely. A defense against working memory challenges is to abide by pre-determined coding conventions that free up valuable memory ability. Over time, your understanding of typical conventions should grow stronger so your mind can devote less attention to details that are unconsciously absorbed. 

An additional challenge with coding is the demands on long-term memory where users are required to keep overall architecture, dead-end strategies, and future directions all within their minds even years after committing the code. A proper defense against long-term memory issues is to write dead simple code that can quickly be evaluated.
